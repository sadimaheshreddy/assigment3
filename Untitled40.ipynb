    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF: The Cumulative Distribution Function gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. It‚Äôs the cumulative sum of probabilities up to that point.\n",

    "Parameters:\n",
    "Mean (Œº): The center of the distribution (where the peak occurs).\n",
    "Standard Deviation (œÉ): Controls the spread of the distribution. A larger œÉ results in a wider, flatter curve, while a smaller œÉ results in a narrower, taller curve.\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: The normal distribution is important because it describes many natural phenomena and measurement errors. It‚Äôs used in statistical methods like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",

    "Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: A discrete probability distribution of a random variable which has two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Tossing a coin (heads = success, tails = failure).\n",
    "Difference between Bernoulli and Binomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli: Deals with a single trial (one coin flip).\n",
    "Binomial: Deals with multiple independent trials (multiple coin flips) with a fixed probability of success for each trial.\n",

    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",

    "Central Limit Theorem: The theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
